* Aims:
  - Make sure that the player knows what they should be doing next
  - Civ style addiction - one more turn
  - Needs to communicate that wants come from the surrogate, and not the player
* Secondary aims:
  - Add maintenance costs
  - Add depth to the decision making by instituting more trade-offs
  - Allowing the micro-optimizations of completing multiple wishes simultaneously
  - Push players to build more things
  - Push players to build a variety of things
  - Reinforcing decisions already made - cooking gets you cooking wishes
  - Recognizing major player decisions
* Pieces:
  - Can be used to heal/hurt traits
  - Should put a timer on them
  - Limit the number that can be active at any time?
  - Make them take up focus
  - Squash them with will
  - Generate them from traits? From producers?
  - Don't remake duplicates
  - Try letting the player decide which wishes to take
    - Try having all of the traits have a number of wishes associated with them
* Requirements:
  - Needs a reward, possibly trait health + will is insufficient
    - Look at lifetime happiness for The Sims, the currency doesn't do much from a gameplay perspective
    - It has strong story-telling though

* Translation issues from The Sims:
  - Representing hurting the trait
  - It feels too much in control. The game is all about managing a person and this undercuts that
  - It doesn't do maintenance cleanly

* Things to do [3/9]:
  - [X] Generate wishes from items that are alive
  - [X] Uniquify the wishes
  - [X] Make the wish generation dependent on the number of wishes alive
  - [ ] Make the wishes scale in order to provide maintenance
  - [ ] Make wishes for things not tried yet
  - [ ] Have finishing goals make other goals more likely
  - [ ] Make goal archetypes
  - [ ] Make leveling the trait add goal archetypes.
  - [ ] Make goal to level the trait.
