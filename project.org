* DONE Polish [8/8]:
  - [X] Plot out sprint 1/1
  - [X] Try placing traits as well. 4/2
    - Try placing seed traits and having them grow, so you don't need to place all of them next to each other.
    - Remember to do this for people as well
  - [X] Try having towers sprout up occasionally from empty sources. 3/3
  - [X] Emotions must do more 4/3
    - [X] Make the id do more to reflect emotional state - make it grow and show the sum of the emotional state
  - [X] Make the focus level do more to affect the emotional state 1/2
    - Make it change the spawn rate of emotions
  - [X] Make towers more random 2/4
    - Eg; talking to someone can just be a source of sadness instead of something to help you with your emotions
    - Have dating someone sometimes add a ton of joy and sometimes a ton of fear and sometimes a ton of sadness
  - [X] Consider making memories into traits 15/5
    - Have them grow like other traits and give them towers
    - The player can reflect on them to have them trigger
    - The player can try to understand them to remove them
  - [X] Separate the story into multiple independent story lines 4/8
* UI Debt
** Setting a queue of items.
** Make the inventory clearer.
   - Players probably don't need to know how much is required to complete an itemAction on the top level
** Show currency deltas
** Hotlinking across panels
** Buttons to move/delete existing things
** Clicking on towers should open a panel too.
** Put the traits buttons into the towers panel
** Put the traits buttons into the panel for self.
** DONE Make the state of what you are currently building clearer
   - Right click to cancel
** DONE Clearer about showing the lifetime of various goals.
** DONE Show the active emotion generators when a trait is set to active.
** DONE Change the tower building UI to be tabbed by trait and show how much space the trait has. 1/2
** DONE Make a UI element that represents a completed action element and shows the result. 1/1
   - Make it click to dismiss.
* Social Debt:
** TODO Article on RPS 0/6
  - Renowned Explorers has this piece
** GitHub for HexMap
** Article on engineering for this game
** Article on interesting decisions in competitive games vs. simulation games.
   - Point on how competitive games force you to engage with their systems
   - You can guarantee that players will engage with an infinite depth well in competitive games.
** Wiki for ecsCompiler
* Technical Debt
** Make events generated by towers also count toward item goals.
** Refactor the emotion entity maker system
   - Instead of this, it should use the sentinel system to check if it is active
   - It should also use the executable to make the entities
   - You should be able to kill this system
** Clean up save/load
   - How do isaac entities and create executables work with save/load?
** Rename towerAction to itemAction
** Take the spawnSourceKey out of the item
   - It is used to build the wish
   - Figure that out from the trait that kills the wish
** Rename the currency attribute of the tick emotion component to tickCurrency
** [#C] Splitting the entities by which systems they can hit is relatively free
   - Make rule and map entity lists for instance
** DONE Auto-generate the tower source csv
** DONE Create a source extension gen_csv
   - Generate all of the things at the top of the ecs file
   - Generate the extension name for the built sources
* Design Debt
** [#A] Tower differentiation
** [#A] Creep differentiation
   - Make the different emotions different
** DONE Paraming the feeling of momentum into the game.
** What is the metaphor for building more towers?
   - It feels like it should represent committing more to an activity, but the game doesn't really support that.
   - The additive nature of the towers is also not good.
   - Maybe combine it with the leveling up of the source?
** Are the core emotions correct?
** Make the controlledName of the goal be dynamically generated from the source that contributed the most to the goal
** CSV audit - see how much can be dynamically generated
** When I exercise to deal with anger, it deals with all of the anger, not just the anger on a certain path.
   - The game is very weird with how it represents this.
   - Does that really work though? You're better prepared for certain emotions from certain sources than others.
** Check how much of the game incentivizes what results
   - Look at how much of the game pushes you to build one kind of tower vs many
   - Look at whether increasing focus cost for having a lot of a single tower is a good idea or not
     - I think philosphically, I want to represent that being good at a lot of activities is easier than being great at a few
     - Also, I need to give you difficult achievements that you need a lot of a single tower for.
** Developing personality traits
  - Developing them is important
  - Choosing not to develop them is also important and must be a decison that players can make consciously and not just a failure to do something
  - But you need to also be able to develop them accidentally
* Site Debt:
** Add a screenshot of the game to /blog/city
** Put a city screenshot on the front page
** Add descriptions to /blog/city
** Put the static web pages into the same template as the rest of the site
** Look into making the whole site static
** Make an article list like /blog/city
** Move posts into subfolders
   - Article notes
   - Articles
   - Make missing links go through subfolders to find the right link
** Replace the paths may vary tab with city
* Bugs:
** DONE Sometimes you cannot restart specific activities
   - Save/load fixes this though
** DONE Save/load is broken again
** DONE Game stages are not transitioning correctly
** DONE Building a button through the game stage doesn't work for setting that button's tags
   - Just put the tags in the csv file
** DONE Fix people buttons and actions.
   - Implement required opinions as part of this.
* Missing major things
  - Give other people creeps that are running through them.
  - Monsters
  - Trait store with lifetime emotions as a currency.
  - Location
