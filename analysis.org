* The core remains constant
* Aesthetics:
  - Novel representations
  - Generating meaningful narrative
  - Challenge
  - Self-Expression
* Dynamics
  - Choosing what action to take right now
    - Time pressure assoicated with that.
    - Focus and will as limiters
  - Building up emotional state
  - Building up will to do something big
  - Developing personality
  - Needing to adjust your day due to random events
    - If a day has you waking up depressed, then you may be unable to hit your work target for the day.
    - When things make you angry, you may want to avoid talking to people
  - Needing to deal with emotions
    - Having to kill them becuase if you let them bounce around in the mind, they multiply.

* Current Issues on my mind
  - The game doesn't handle extreme emotions well
  - The towers are very opaque
    - It's hard to tell which ones are any good
    - It's hard to tell what they're doing.
  - The economy for item actions doesn't work out with people being able to build multiple towers
    - The tower cap mitigates this, but not enough
    - Could be done by restructuring items into infinite work and projects
  - Need another piece to emphasize management of emotions
    - Right now, the actual numbers of each tend to be irrelevant. Everything that's not the extreme feels meaningless.
  - Need another long term piece

* Things to work on
  - towerEmotionSource (fold them into memories)
  - All the things that make entities (fold them)
  - boosts
  - emotionTickModifier - Make it more prominent and give it more instances. Also, actually integrate it.
  - featureItemActionExec - Entities that cause goals to require a different amount of currency. Again, interesting, but not integrated.
  - emotion entity maker system - Creation of entities based off emotions and active sources. Again, interesting, but not integrated.

* Dynamics to support more
  - Viruses, activitites going south far enough that you can't do them any more
  - Generating traits
    - Memories becoming traits
