- Need to balance diversifying activities
- The focus system pushes you to only building a single thing
- It becomes ridiculous with short activities and many towers
- I don't really understand the metaphor
  - Doing things faster makes sense
  - Does this represent getting better at something
  - Should this just be as simple as spending will on this? That's not the best metaphor
  - Taking that away really hurts the gameplay of towers though
  - Given the experience system, it's not bad.
- Also needs to require lots of towers for completing certain tasks.
- Maybe cap some tasks with the number of towers they can activate.
